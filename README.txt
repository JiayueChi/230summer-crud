node-modules directory is not included, so make sure to install npm before running, install the following:

npm install
npm install mongodb
npm install express
npm install cors

node server.js

Note:
Open openMe.html first, as it is the index page and 
make the whole solution easier to understand when you are marking. 
Making sure when you clicking the buttons, try to click on the underlined link, 
coz it won’t navigate you to the certain page if it’s not clicked. :)

A database description is at the buttom of seerver.js as required.
